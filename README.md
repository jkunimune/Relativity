# Relativity
An ultra-realistic space game.
Dodge around asteroids in a dense cluster in order to rescue the helpless escape pods that desperately need your help. Beware, though. This ship of yours is a fresh new model, potentially capable of reaching the speed of light. Who knows what will happen when normal understandings of space and time break down, and all you are left with is relativity?
